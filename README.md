RC-4 Implementation Repository

This repository hosts an implementation of the RC-4 encryption and decryption algorithm using Python and Flask. RC-4, also known as Rivest Cipher 4 or Ron's Code 4, is a symmetric stream cipher algorithm widely utilized in various communication protocols and systems. The implementation provides functionality to encrypt and decrypt messages using RC-4 with a user-specified key.

The repository includes the following components:

Python Implementation: The core RC-4 encryption and decryption logic are implemented in Python. The implementation adheres to the RC-4 algorithm's specifications, including key scheduling and keystream generation.

Flask Web Application: The RC-4 implementation is wrapped within a Flask web application, enabling users to interact with the encryption and decryption functionality through a user-friendly web interface. Users can input plaintext or ciphertext messages along with a key and choose to either encrypt or decrypt the message.

HTML Template: The web interface is designed using HTML, incorporating Bootstrap for styling. The template provides a brief description of RC-4 and offers input fields for the message and key, as well as a dropdown menu for selecting the desired operation (encryption or decryption). The output field dynamically displays the encrypted or decrypted result based on user input.

This repository serves as a comprehensive resource for understanding and utilizing RC-4 encryption and decryption techniques, providing both a standalone Python implementation and a user-friendly web application for practical usage.
